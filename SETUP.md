## Prerequisites.

To run this project you should have `python 3.13` installed on your system and `uv` package to be installed. To install uv run the following command:

`pip install uv`

## Setup in your system.

- Clone the repository into your local system.

- Then run the following commands:

`uv sync`

`uv run set_secret_key`

Now you can run all the commands prefix with `uv run manage.py` instead of `python manage.py` prefix.

And you are good to go.
